# Table: scaleway_rdb_database - Query Scaleway RDB Databases using SQL

A Scaleway RDB Database is a managed relational database service that offers automated backups, high availability, and the ability to scale capacity up or down based on demand. It supports multiple database engines including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis. With Scaleway RDB Database, you can focus on your application logic rather than managing database infrastructure.

## Table Usage Guide
